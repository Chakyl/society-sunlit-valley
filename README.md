# Society: Sunlit Valley
**Society: Sunlit Valley** is a farming commerce Minecraft modpack in the style of games like Stardew Valley and Harvest moon. As you progress, you'll use coins to purchase new items, upgrade your gear, and gain tools to make money even faster.

## Contribution Guide
- Pull requests (PR) can be made in the [society-sunlit-valley repo](https://github.com/Chakyl/society-sunlit-valley)
- PRs should target the next update branch, if it exists not `master`. Check in with Chakyl if you don't know which branch is next.
- PRs should include a list of changelog items in a similar format as [here](https://github.com/Chakyl/society-sunlit-valley/blob/master/config/fancymenu/assets/changelog.markdown?plain=1)
## Easily accepted contributions
- **Documentation**: Quest related work, tips, new tooltips, etc. A large exception is any information that's intended to be hidden (ask if you don't know!)
- **Minor touchups**: Textures, typos, bugfixes
- **Tag/recipe cleanup**: Via romana road tags, sawmill recipes, etcetera chisel/hammering, compacting drawer recipes, etc
## Likely to be contested/tweaked
- **Balance changes**: Value changes/additions, significant recipe changes, trade prices
- **Large code refactors**: These just take more time to review and verify
- **Translations**: It takes time to find a native reader of a translation language that is willing to review translations, there's no way around that.
## Discuss before starting (to avoid wasting your time)
- **Content additions/reworks**: New mechanics or significant changes to current mechanics (e.g, putting veggies in a dehydrator). Discuss these beforehand to avoid working on things that are already actively in dev or things that won't be added
- **Mod additions**:  Mods will have to meet a very high threshold to be added to the pack at this point in development
## Automatically denied contributions
- **License violating work**: Any work that breaks the license of another project will automatically be denied. This includes but is not limited to copying assets or code from an ARR mod without express permission.
- **AI generated work**: Any work using generative AI will automatically be denied. This is for similar reasons as QEMU's policy which you can read [here](https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/master/docs/devel/code-provenance.rst#use-of-ai-content-generators).
- **AI generated assets**: See the above. Sunlit Valley has multiple people on the team that can create or assist with creating assets you need for your work.
- **Machine Translations**: Translations have a high bar for being merged. I believe no translation is better than a translation that is unvetted, misleading, or even incorrect.
