# #----------------------------------------------------------------------
#     Welcome to CSC! CSC (formerly Create:SchematicChecker | Create: Schematic Validator)
# is a blueprint scanning mod specifically designed for Create and all its addons. It helps prevent any known potential or malicious exploits.
# These exploits include, but are not limited to: item duplication, server lag or crashes, unauthorized access to creative items, and even server control takeover.
# Triggering these issues only requires uploading a blueprint with modified parameters, making server disruption extremely easy. With a schematic cannon, anyone can freely
# damage the server at minimal cost and in very little time.
#   This mod was specifically designed to solve these issues and permanently fix blueprint vulnerabilities in Create!
# CSC allows users to customize blacklist tags and blocks, define exclusion rules, and configure detailed validation behavior for schematics.
# Thanks to the universal nature of schematics, CSC can scan and validate content from Create and all its related mods!
# If users opt in, CSC can even connect online to automatically sync rule updates to the local server. Whenever the CSC team discovers a new exploit,
# the configuration file will be updated automatically, allowing potential threats to be removed without restarting the server.
# Choose a language you want to use     zh_ch / en_us 
Language = "en_us"
